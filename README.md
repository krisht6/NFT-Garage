# NFT-Garage

# Abstract
NFT Garage is a decentralized application (dApp), enabling users to mint, customize, and display digital cars NFTs on the Sepolia testnet. Using Ethereum smart contracts, the project automates the minting of five unique cars—Honda Civic, Subaru WRX, Lexus ES350, BMW M4 Competition, and Audi R8—stored as NFTs with metadata hosted on Pinata via IPFS. The front-end, hosted on GitHub Pages, integrates Web3.js for wallet interactions, allowing users to purchase NFTs using the Yoda ERC-20 token. Right now, the customization of car mods is done on the backend in Remix.
